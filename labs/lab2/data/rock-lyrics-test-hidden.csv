hidden,"A hundred days have made me older Since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lies have made me colder And I don't think I can look at this the same But all the miles that separate Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face  I'm here without you, baby But you're still on my lonely mind I think about you, baby And I dream about you all the time I'm here without you, baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah  The miles just keep rolling As the people leave their way to say hello I've heard this life is overrated But I hope that it gets better as we go Oh yeah, yeah  I'm here without you, baby But you're still on my lonely mind I think about you, baby And I dream about you all the time I'm here without you, baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight it's only you and me, yeah  Everything I know, and anywhere I go It gets hard, but it won't take away my love And when the last one falls When it's all said and done It gets hard, but it won't take away my love Whoa, oh, oh  I'm here without you, baby But you're still on my lonely mind I think about you, baby And I dream about you all the time I'm here without you, baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, girl, it's only you and me"
hidden,Say goodbye to all my troubles Say goodbye to this I'm saying goodbye to all the desperation I've lived in It doesn't hurt to talk about it It sometimes helps me through Now there's nothing left to talk about I'll tell you...  Now it's time to say goodbye I've been living this lie for way to long I can't handle this life got to say goodbye I've been living this lie for way to long  Blame it on this way of thinking Blame it on someone There's no answers only questions that have come undone It doesn't help to think about it It only makes me feel used Now there's nothing left to think about Nothing's true...   I've been living this lie for way to long I can't handle this life got to say goodbye I've been living this lie for way to long  I wish that we could do this all again I wish that I could stay but I can't And now it's time to leave this all behind Of all the things to say we said goodbye   I can't handle this life I can't handle this life I can't handle this life I'm dead
hidden,"What happens to a man when He spills his heart on a page and He watches words flow away then His feelings lie on the page alone There waiting For someone who cares to read them To open their eyes to see them To see if they can make his thoughts their own  To find out that maybe your life's not perfect Maybe it's not worth what he gives away  You can see that this broken soul is bleeding So you concede your feelings inside yourself And wander through my heart Letting you see through me Now only consumes me Forget your pain, watch me fall apart  What happens to a soul when It's trapped inside his emotions And all of these words he's spoken They bind him to the life he's left behind And every new step he takes he Knows that he might not make it To all of these dreams that he has yet to find  Maybe your life's not perfect But maybe it's not worth what he gives away  You can see that this broken soul is bleeding So you concede your feelings inside yourself And wander through my heart Letting you see through me Now only consumes me Forget your pain and watch me fall apart As I fall apart You can see that this broken soul is bleeding So you concede your feelings inside yourself And wander through my heart Letting you see through me Now only consumes me Forget your pain and watch me fall apart As I fall apart"

Was is just a dream, everything we did Everything we had?  Baby, give me one last Dance while the music still goes on Just like the night I met you Dance and believe me, when you're gone You know I won't forget you Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away You tell me it's over, what more can I say? So dance while the music still goes on It's going to be our last goodbye  Dance while the music still goes on Don't think about tomorrow Dance and forget our time is gone Tonight's a night we borrow Let's make it a memory, a night of our own A thing to remember when we're all alone So dance while the music still goes on And let it be our last goodbye  Dance while the music still goes on This is no time for crying Just like the night I met you Dance and believe me, when you're gone Dance while the music still goes on You know I won't forget you Dance while the music still goes on"

Placing the phone back on the hook, she turns to see three smartly dressed men standing in her kitchen doorway Before she realizes what is happening to her, she is rolled tightly in long sheets of cellophane, transported to an international airport, and placed on a waiting jet-liner All this being too much for her to comprehend, she passes out Upon awakening, she finds herself in a strange, foreign speaking nation (""Dalas nekcihc dna tihs nekcihc neewteb ecnereffid eht wonk ot suineg a Ekat t'nseod ti."") Alone, fearing her escape impossible, she seeks comfort in the arms of a confidential agent With the trace of her kiss still warm upon his lips, he betrays her to the hands of three scientists who are engaged in diabolical, avant-garde experiments previously performed only on insects and other small, meaningless creatures Using her as their subject, they are delighted with the results. For the first time, a human being is transformed into a-- ""Shhh... It's secret"" Meanwhile, back in Portland, Maine... Her husband, Don, now chain-smoking 40 packs of cigarettes a day, sits at a local bar and has a few beers with the regulars. Bored, everyone's attention turns to the television set that just hangs from the wall (""Welcome to Bowling for Dollars"") Suddenly, crazy Al says, ""S-say, Don. There sure is something familiar about that bowling ball."" To which a terrified Don replies, ""Oh my God! That bowling ball! It's my wife!"" And the lesson we learn from this story is, next time you place your order Don't forget to say, ""No anchovies, please."""

hidden,"I was running down the road The fear was all I knew I was looking for a soul that’s real Then I ran into you And that cherry blossom tree Was a gateway to the sun And friendship, once it’s won It’s won... it’s won  Northside just across the river to the Southside That’s a long way here All the green and all the gold The hurt you hide, The joy you hold The foolish pride That gets you out the door Up on Cedarwood Road, On Cedarwood Road  Sleepwalking down the road Not waking from these dreams ‘Cause it’s never dead it’s still my head It was a warzone in my teens I’m still standing on that street Still need an enemy The worst ones I can’t see You can... you can  Northside just across the river to the Southside That’s a long way here All the green and all the gold The hurt you hide and the joy you hold The foolish pride that sends you back for more Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road  If the door is open it isn’t theft You can’t return to where you’ve never left Blossoms falling from a tree they cover you and cover me Symbols clashing, bibles smashing Paint the world you need to see Sometimes fear is the only place that we can call our home Cedarwood Road  And a heart that is broken Is a heart that is open, open, open"
hidden,"From the brightest star Comes the blackest hole You had so much to offer Why did you offer your soul? I was there for you baby When you needed my help Would you deny for others What you demand for yourself?  Cool down mama, cool off Cool down mama, cool off  You speak of signs and wonders But I need something other I would believe if I was able But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table  You were pretty as a picture It was all there to see Then your face caught up with your psychology With a mouth full of teeth You ate all your friends And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends  You speak of signs and wonders But I need something other I would believe if I was able But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table  Where you live should not decide Whether you live or whether you die Three to a bed ""Sister Ann,"" she said ""Dignity passes by""  (And) You speak of signs and wonders But I need something other I would believe if I was able I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table Hey!"
hidden,"The sea, it swells like a sore head And the night, it is aching Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed And the day it is breaking  On rainy days we'd go swimming out On rainy days, swimming in the sound On rainy days we'd go swimming out  You're in my mind all of the time I know that's not enough If the sky can crack there must be someway back For love and only love Electrical storm Electrical storm Baby, don't cry  Car alarm won't let you back to sleep You're kept awake dreaming someone else's dream Coffee is cold but it'll get you through Compromise, that's nothing new to you  Let's see colors that have never been seen Let's go places no one else has been  You're in my mind all of the time I know that's not enough Well, if the sky can crack there must be someway back To love and only love Electrical storm Electrical storm Electrical storm Baby, don't cry  It's hot as hell, honey, in this room Sure hope the weather will break soon The air is heavy, heavy as a truck We need the rain to wash away our bad luck  Hey! Hey!  Well if the sky can crack there must be some way back To love and only love Electrical storm Electrical storm Electrical storm Baby, don't cry Baby, don't cry Baby, don't cry Baby, don't cry"
hidden,"High, higher than the sun You shoot me from a gun I need you to elevate me here At the corner of your lips As the orbit of your hips Eclipse, you elevate my soul I've lost all self-control Been living like a mole Now going down, excavation I and I in the sky You make me feel like I can fly So high, elevation A star lit up like a cigar Strung out like a guitar Maybe you could educate my mind Explain all these controls I can't sing but I've got soul The goal is elevation A mole, living in a hole Digging up my soul Going down, excavation I and I in the sky You make me feel like I can fly So high, elevation Love, lift me out of these blues Won't you tell me something true I believe in you A mole, living in a hole Digging up my soul Going down, excavation I and I in the sky You make me feel like I can fly So high, elevation Elevation... Elevation... Elevation... Elevation... Elevation... Elevation..."
